-- Introduction To The Project -- 

Hello, this is a project that I made for a game that I am currently developing - Call Of The Wild. I have been developing it for around 4 - 5 months so far (with breaks i.e., like around 1 month or 2 weeks). It is not yet complete but will hopefully be near completion or at least at it's ALPHA phase near mid June / around start of July. Thanks for viewing this and I hope this helped! Also note that it won't work with raw copy and paste of scripts because you need to create your own texture and create empty game objects and add some scripts as components of them. I might make a tutorial of this in th future if I have the time for it! The scripts are all in C# and to add scripts to your game simply download Visual Studio Code and use that to edit C# / JavaScript scripts. It is more recommended for C# scripts while using Unity since it is much easier in my opinion. Enjoy!

 -- Scripts & Folders Setup -- 
 
 1. Add The scripts to the game and set it up to components in the game (i.e., game objects) - I might make a tutorial in th future if you don't understand what I mean.
 2. Create folders called - "Editor" and "Data", in the assets folder.
 3. You can leave the other scripts that don't have a comment asking you to put the script to the respective folder in the assets folder.
 4. Make sure that the names of the script are similar to the names referenced in the C# Scripts.
 5. Create your texture holders and shaders for it to work.
 6. You're done! Enjoy the procedurally generated landmass.
