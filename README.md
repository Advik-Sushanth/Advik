Hello, this is a project that I made for a game that I am currently developing - Call Of The Wild. I have been developing it for around 4 - 5 months so far (with breaks i.e., like around 1 month or 2 weeks). It is not yet complete but will hopefully be near completion or at least at it's ALPHA phase near mid June / around start of July. Thanks for viewing this and I hope this helped! Also note that it won't work with raw copy and paste of scripts because you need to create your own texture and create empty game objects and add some scripts as components of them. I might make a tutorial of this in th future if I have the time for it!
